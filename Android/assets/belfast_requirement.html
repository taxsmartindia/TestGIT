All applicants must be either final year degree students, post graduates or have successfully obtained a third level degree qualification.
We don’t just look for people who are academically high achievers or limit applicants to those who have studied law. We accept degrees from all disciplines.
We look for candidates who are commercially aware and have the personality and disposition to become a top class lawyer.
We also look for evidence of the following attributes: <br/>
<ul>
   <li>Ambition & commitment: We look for people who have a real zeal to learn more and develop as lawyers in a commercial law firm. Our trainees need to show drive and determination and demonstrate how they have excelled in challenging positions previously.</li>
 <li>Teamwork: A key criterion is the ability to work on a team because this is the approach we take to all of our client problems. Trainees need to demonstrate to us that this is something which comes very naturally to them.</li>
  <li>Problem Solving: We need trainees who try to see a problem from all angles, who can logically work through potential solutions and understand their pros and cons, but also suggest alternative solutions, which many not be the norm, but may be just what our client needs.</li>
  <li>Effective Communication: Our trainees have to be effective communicators with an ability to put across their message in a simple concise manner.</li>
<li>Commercial Awareness: We are looking for trainees who have shown a genuine interest in and aptitude for business because while we are lawyers, we aim to be trusted business advisors to our clients and operate at all times on a commercial level.
<li>Adaptability: Trainees need to be flexible to juggle a varied workload and change priorities based on their team's workload. We look for trainees who are comfortable adapting to different environments and ways of working, as this is how to learn to perform well throughout a career, in any circumstances.</li>
<li>Future Leadership: Above all then, we are looking for the next generation of A&L Goodbody lawyers who can lead the practice in future years.</li>
