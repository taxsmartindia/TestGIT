<b>Here is why we think our programme is the very best Trainee Programme available to you:</b>
<b>1. Structure</b>
<ul>
<li>We structure our trainee programme around 4 six month rotations or "seats"</li>
<li>Trainee seats are within the firm's main departments: Corporate, Banking & Financial Services, Litigation & Dispute Resolution, Commercial Property, Tax, and Pensions</li>
<li>Discover for yourself just where your interests and strengths lie </li>
</ul>
<b>2. Mentoring</b>
<ul>
<li>Trainees work within teams to provide structured mentoring from partners, associates and more junior lawyers </li>
<li>We want you to see how different people have a variety of styles and approaches to managing client work</li>
<li>Team mentoring shows how styles and skills develop at different stages in your legal career </li>
</ul>
<b>3. Practical Feedback</b>
<ul>
<li>Assessments every three months - mid. and end of seat assessments</li>
<li>Purpose is to give positive affirmation and to discuss any areas for improvement and work on them in the second half of the seat</li>
</ul>
<b>4. Secondments & Seats in Other Offices</b>
<ul>
<li>Secondment opportunities with clients across a range of industries.  You will learn exactly what it is that our clients look for in their lawyers</li>
<li>Opportunity to complete a seat in our London or Belfast offices, to see what life is like in those cities and how client needs vary in different locations</li>
<li>Trainees on secondment / in other offices continue to receive trainee programme support and guidance</li>
</ul>
<b>5. Legal Education & Learning
<ul>
<li>Education programme has three broad strands:</li>
<ul>
<li>In house knowledge sharing presentations: Our top lawyers give trainees presentations on their areas of expertise, recent developments and upcoming developments in law in their area</li>
<li>Trainee Workshops: Depending on the department you are in, you will participate in a series of practical, partner led workshops which focus on the key practical skills required to practice in specific areas of law</li>
<li>Trainee Knowledge sharing: Led by the trainees themselves. Trainees simulate a client briefing or a client meeting where the other trainees act as clients in a real live meeting room scenario</li>
</ul></ul>
<b>6. Non-Legal Skills Development</b>

<p>In addition to our Trainee Education Programme, we provide seminar programmes and training sessions delivered by our award winning knowledge, business support and training teams here in A&L Goodbody, as well as external consultants, to give you all of the skills that you are going to need outside of pure legal knowledge</p>
