<ul>
<li target="1" class="show_hide"><b>What is the milkround?</b></li>
<div id="div1" class="slidingDiv"><p>The "Milkround" is the term given to presentations and interviews held on or off campus by organisations seeking to recruit graduates. </p></div>

<li target="2" class="show_hide"><b>Is there someone I can discuss opportunities with before I accept a Traineeship?</b></li>
<div id="div2" class="slidingDiv"><p>You can discuss the prospect of a Traineeship with Alan Roberts, Partner with responsibility for our Trainee Programme and Clodagh Collier, Trainee & Intern Programme Manager. </p></div>

<li target="3" class="show_hide"><b>How do I apply for a Traineeship?</b></li>
<div id="div3" class="slidingDiv"><p>You can apply on line. You will need to register on our website.  You will then be asked to complete a short situational judgment test and complete our application form on-line. </p></div>

<li target="4" class="show_hide"><b>Who can apply?</b></li>
<div id="div4" class="slidingDiv"><p>All final year students, post graduates and those who have successfully obtained a third level degree qualification. </p></div>

<li target="5" class="show_hide"><b>Must I have studied law?</b></li>

<li target="6" class="show_hide"><b>Do you have any preference as to where I attained my degree?</b></li>
<div id="div6" class="slidingDiv"><p>No.</p></div>

<li target="7" class="show_hide"><b>Do you have a preference as to which modules I studied during my law degree?</b></li>
<div id="div7" class="slidingDiv"><p>No.</p></div>

<li target="8" class="show_hide"><b>Would an internship help my application?</b></li>
<div id="div8" class="slidingDiv"><p>Yes, an internship gives you the opportunity to experience life at A&L Goodbody. Interns work closely with Partners, Fee Earners and Trainee Solicitors alike. You get a taste of the Firm’s culture, clients and social life and an opportunity to network with your peers and other members of the legal profession. However, just as importantly, it also allows you to demonstrate to us how you might perform as a Trainee Solicitor and gives us the opportunity to get to know you a little better, socially and in the working environment. </p></div>

<li target="9" class="show_hide"><b>How many Trainee Solicitors do you recruit annually?</b></li>
<div id="div9" class="slidingDiv"><p>The number varies from year to year, but normally we recruit between 25 – 30 Trainee Solicitors per annum. It is important for us to support the Firm’s resource strategy by taking in top calibre Trainee Solicitors who we hope will stay with the Firm in the long term. We are focused on ensuring all Trainee Solicitors have a positive experience with A&L Goodbody whereby each Trainee Solicitor has all the support and training they need during their Traineeship. Therefore, we monitor our intake numbers to ensure we can deliver a quality Traineeship to those who have been offered a position with the Firm. </p></div>

<li target="10" class="show_hide"><b>What intake dates are you currently recruiting for?</b></li>
<div id="div10" class="slidingDiv"><p>We are currently recruiting for 2014 and 2015 and a limited number of positions in 2013.</p></div>

<li target="11" class="show_hide"><b>Do Trainee Solicitors get a choice of rotations / seats?</b></li>
<div id="div11" class="slidingDiv"><p>Trainees are not normally given a choice of seats, however, we do try to accommodate any preferences. Law Society requirements dictate the compulsory seats which are in Corporate, Litigation & Dispute Resolution, Commercial Property, Tax and Pensions. </p></div>

<li target="12" class="show_hide"><b>Which practice areas do Trainee Solicitors work in?</b></li>
<div id="div12" class="slidingDiv"><p>Trainees will work in some of our main departments, namely: Corporate, Litigation & Dispute Resolution, Banking & Financial Services, Commercial Property and Private Client. </p></div>

<li target="13" class="show_hide"><b>What is your retention rate for keeping Trainee Solicitors on after qualification?</b></li>
<div id="div13" class="slidingDiv"><p>We have an excellent retention rate, it is circa 85%.</p></div>

<li target="14" class="show_hide"><b>Once I’ve accepted an offer when do I start my Traineeship?</b></li>
<div id="div14" class="slidingDiv"><p>Our official start date is in April of each year but at the firm’s discretion we can accommodate a start date in June for students who have to sit FE1 exams in April. </p></div>

<li target="15" class="show_hide"><b>I want to travel for a year before I start my Traineeship to get some more “life experience”, can I do this?</b></li>
<div id="div15" class="slidingDiv"><p>We are very happy to accommodate requests to defer commencement of Traineeships if you would like to travel or pursue further studies before commencing your Traineeship. </p></div>

<li target="16" class="show_hide"><b>Do I need to have “Life Experience” to get a traineeship?</b></li>
<div id="div16" class="slidingDiv"><p>Challenging yourself outside of your comfort zone means that you can bring something more to the table as a Trainee.  Your life experience will help you adjust to the challenges that traineeship brings and often helps you cope when in pressure situations, so yes, we encourage offerees to go out and sample some of what life has to offer before beginning your traineeship, but again it’s not a pre-requisite and is very much a personal decision.  </p></div>

<li target="17" class="show_hide"><b>How do I differentiate myself on my application form?</b></li>
<div id="div17" class="slidingDiv"><p>Students often ask how they differentiate themselves in their application form.  It is very important to think about what you are putting on your application and about what it is a corporate law firm might look for/expect in a candidate.  Demonstrating commercial awareness is very important:</p>
<ul>
<li>do you read the business pages?</li>
<li>what legal developments are currently taking place in Ireland / abroad?</li>
<li>what are the biggest challenges currently facing law firms?</li>
<li>what are the biggest challenges facing our clients?</li>
<li>be able to form an opinion and articulate it.</li>
<li>demonstrate what you know about the firm.</li>
</ul></div>

<li target="18" class="show_hide"><b>Should I do a Masters?</b></li>
<div id="div18" class="slidingDiv"><p>Our position is that its very much something for you to decide upon.  We provide full training for all Trainees.  In conjunction with your professional courses at Blackhall Place, you will be fully prepared for life as a solicitor when you qualify.  Therefore, having a Masters degree is not a pre-requisite to getting an offer from A&LG.  Doing a Masters is expensive undertaking and whilst there is certainly no negative impact in doing a Masters (our view is that all knowledge is helpful), applicants should not feel that they “need” to have a Masters to get into A&L.  It is very much a personal decision.</p></div>

<li target="19" class="show_hide"><b>Will my Law Society fees be paid?</b></li>
<div id="div19" class="slidingDiv"><p>Yes, once you commence your traineeship, all Law Society fees will be paid in full.</p></div>

Working as a Trainee your professional development here at A&L Goodbody is a priority.
