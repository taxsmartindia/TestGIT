<b>Andrew Spratt - Assistant Solicitor</b><br/>


I trained with the firm, qualifying into the Employment unit of the Belfast office in September 2009.  In the course of my training I spent time in the Corporate, Commercial Property and Litigation seats, and interacted throughout, with clients, senior solicitors and with Counsel.  Having talked with friends working in other firms, the things that set A&L apart are the quality of work, the team dynamic and the responsibility given to me from day one.  As an Assistant solicitor qualified into the employment unit, I advise corporate clients on both contentious and non-contentious matters on a daily basis – this may mean working with the corporate department on a multi million, multi jurisdiction international acquisition one week, and leading a witness through their evidence in the Employment Tribunal the next.
